# CubeSimulator
A Rubik's Cube simulator built using Three.js. This was my first project in Three.js.

To turn the faces of the cube, use standard cube notation:

  - F - Front Face
  - U - Up Face
  - R - Right Face
  - D - Down Face
  - L - Left Face
  - B - Back Face
 
To execute an inverse turn (counterclockwise) hold shift before pressing the button for the respective face.

Use the arrow keys to move the camera, and X and Z to zoom in and out.

Alternatively to typing face names, click and drag can be used to manipulate the cube.
Just make sure the mouse is on a face of the cube at the end of the drag.
